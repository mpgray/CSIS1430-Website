         <p> I enjoy spending time with friends; going to the shooting range on occasion;
             or just hanging out at the local gaming shop. I am also a fan of movies and
             comedy clubs.<br>
             In addition to going to school full-time to earn my degree, I also work in Data Entry and Analysis
             full-time. I enjoy the people and the casual environment.
